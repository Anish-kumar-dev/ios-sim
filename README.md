ios-sim
=======

Supports Xcode 6 only since version 3.x.

The ios-sim tool is a command-line utility that launches an iOS application on
the iOS Simulator. This allows for niceties such as automated testing without
having to open Xcode.

Features
--------

* Choose the device family to simulate, i.e. iPhone or iPad. Run using "showdevicetypes" option to see available device types, and pass it in as the "devicetypeid" parameter.
* Setup environment variables.
* Pass arguments to the application.
* See the stdout and stderr, or redirect them to files.

See the `--help` option for more info.
